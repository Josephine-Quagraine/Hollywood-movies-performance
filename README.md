# Hollywood-movies-performance
This was one of 4 assignments given during a 3 months course on data analysis by JustIT. This project focused on data cleaning in R by checking for missing values, dropping missing values and removing duplicates. Numeric values were rounded off to 2 decimal places, and boxplot was generated in R to determine outliers in the data frame and removed. After data cleaning, had 61 obserations and 8 columns of cleaned data for downstream analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out in R using univariate and bivariate analysis. For bivariate analysis, did a scatterplot comparing rotten tomatoes ratings to lead studios and a bar chart which showed the number of movies produced each year from 2007 to 2011. Analysis indicated that there was a strong correlation between ratings and lead studio with the highest rated movies belonging to Disney, Sony, Universal and also Independent. The cleaned consistent data renamed HW_df1 was exported and used to create visualizations in Power BI.
